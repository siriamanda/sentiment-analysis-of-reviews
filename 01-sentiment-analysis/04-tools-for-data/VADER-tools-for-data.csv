28,2021-02-21,"Poorly designed course.Week 1: While the first section was ok, after the section on
âData Science Toolsâ, it was more or less just a list of tools for data
science. I have 5 pages of notes that are mostly useless. The only reason I
wrote so much was that the quizzes often asked about such useless details, that
I learned to write more than I usually would. Whoever designed the course/tests
obviously has no real teaching experience. In addition, do not expect any
feedback from the quizzes. There is no attempt to help the learner learn from
wrong answers.The quality of most of the âinstructionâ was poor. The woman
reading the script often did not logically pause when a slide was changed or
more information was added to the slide, as if she didnât know what was on them.
For most of it, it was just a PowerPoint presentation. For IBM being so
advanced with technology, it seems for most of the teaching they simply used
20-year-old technology to demonstrate some of the most advanced technology that
currently exists. â¹ At
least they could have used a split screen to show a person AND text/screen
shots.Week 2: Better information. Same woman reading slidesâ¦who is
not convincing that she actually understood what she was actually reading.
However, the information was more useful and the tools introduced were better.
Now Iâm registered on some sites and weâll see how useful that is.Week 3: A big mix. Again lots of tools. Different people
speaking, but again they are just PowerPoint slides with no interaction with
people (unlike in the first course in the program). When there are screen captures,
sometimes they just jump and it is difficult to follow as they are quite quick.
Often the screen shots donât have high enough resolution, so many of the tabs
in the programs are either difficult or impossible to read, or they donât
capture the whole screen, so itâs pretty useless as we canât really follow how
it gets from one place to another.Sometimes poor English pronunciation. Why doesnât the person
who actually create the presentations/work with the programs actually do the
speaking?Week 4: Labs are useful and itâs great that there was some
kind of output. Unfortunately, many of the things that you have to do are not
actually taught in the course and you have to use other sources to find out how
to do things.",2,completer,2361,neg,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999968837201507}",en,"{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.1248}",0.1248,pos

These concepts are not properly described and students have to go through the course with only a partial understanding of some core concepts they would need to understand what is further explained in the course... So many things are still really unclear to me now that I have finished this course. It took me quite some time to complete it because I felt demotivated. Now that I have started the next course on Methodology, I feel much better and I see what it is like to have things explained in a pedagogical way! Analogies, repetition, examples... All this is very important to help students navigate a topic as new and sometimes as foreign as Data Science. I was not convinced at all by this course ""Tools for Data Science"" and I do not think that the little knowledge I gathered will stick, as it is not built on solid foundations. I cannot be able to remember what tool will be useful for doing what if I do not know what I can / would do with data science.The labs were good!

393,2020-08-21,"[Reviewing the entire specialization but points are applicable for each course]I signed up for the IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making my way though it and I was amazed â¦ amazed of how much a pile of bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldnât take it anymore. Hereâs why:1. First and foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me but whatever, lets move on.2. The in-video quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous â¦ you are expected to have memorized content word by word rather than understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.3. The final assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.4. We eventually got to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read python and seaborn code in the SQL courseâs tasks even though python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.5. And my final and biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM Watson Studio are â¦ they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality content.6. Now after finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly filled in basically letting them know their specialization if terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfbI was very saddened by the quality of the specialization and the content and was wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting next week.In conclusion, I got this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their courses.",1,completer,3257,neg,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999969790355524}",en,"{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': -0.3375}",-0.3375,neg

You just have to sign up to the platform and hobble along trying to make sense of it. The quizzes were a utter waste of time. They don't even reflect the content in the videos. Many of the questions had topics that were not even covered. I was unable to do the final assignment because it's impossible to get to the Jupyter notebooks page when you sign in. It was an incredibly frustrating experience. I wasn't alone - the discussion forums are filled with hundreds of comments on the same issue - not being able to find the webpage where they need to create a notebook and do the assignment. I did not see any of the moderators even bothering to reply. Why have you put this course out here if you have no interest in providing quality content or help when your content is utterly outdated.
