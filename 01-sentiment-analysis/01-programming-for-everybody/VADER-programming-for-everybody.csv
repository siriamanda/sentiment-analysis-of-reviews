I wasn't sure if I would understand python since I had trouble learning C++ in the past and thought this might be too hard to learn. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I started to understand things and put the pieces together to create my programs. I plan to complete the remaining 4 classes to get the python certification.

1612,2020-12-24,"There's a lot the class doesn't cover, things it doesn't do a great job at being a beginning class. For the FIREST class on python, I'm incredibly disappointed with how its run. The not being able to see what others did and thus know if thats the same thing you did wrong means that every time you are unsure you have to ask a teacher, which can take hours or days to be replied to. I ended up not using any teacher help and instead had to contact a friend who does programming to explain things that were in the homework but no where in the text or videos to explain things that SHOULD have been explained before getting the homework. If you're willing to do your own legwork or don't mind waiting between responses, I'm sure the class is great. Personally, I'm extremely disappointed. Look at the discussion each week, there's tons of questions of just not understanding why things aren't working. Watch out for information in the homework that is wrong or needs to be changed to make it correct instead of leaving blanks which would have been easier to understand in a beginning class. It constantly felt like trying to figure out what they were tricking you with in in the homework by giving you information and equations that don't actually work as written. I'm just not impressed and as someone with a teaching background, I'm pretty disappointed in the execution of this class that should be an absolutely basic class but its also trying to trick you in ways.

Efficiently writing the program such that it actually takes less computer time is something that is difficult to each. Computers work well doing iterative tasks that with fast processors, we do consider how efficient our coding is. In the old days of the cold war when processing power was a competitive and under export control, the Soviet Union which lacked equivalent processor power learned to write code that was very efficient. Hence when the Soviet Union fell, Soviet (Russian) programmer were in high demand by western software companies. Some western software companies even set up research labs in Russia to take advantage of the pool of talented programmers.I will take a bit of time to think in programming language again to write efficient code in Python.

I really liked this review because it's video format which works really 
well for those who have already attempted to learn Python many times 
before through online text resources. It's a fresh style where there is a
 'teacher' that explains the lesson. Dr. Charles Severance is skilled in
 laymanizing programming concepts and most definitely knows what a 
student feels in front of a foreign (programming language)

started this course I had a very little knowledge about programming. Frankly
when I started to do the first lesson, I felt very nervous thinking whether I was
able to complete this because this is my first programming course that I ever
took.  Today, I am very happy that I was
able to successfully finished the course making me adequately enough individual
to write a simple block of code in Python. I believe this is all due to the way
and the amount of course material provided in this course.  Videos are not too long or too short.  The length of all the videos are just right.  I simply cannot resist to mention I love the instructorâs
writings on  slides/screen.  Those writings really helped me to understand
theories and concepts of each lesson.  Besides,
those made me to feel that I was in an actual classroom.  Text
book is written in very simple, clear and concise English making me to read
whole chapter after each lesson without getting distracted or bored. The exercises
provided at the end of each chapter are appropriate and gave me a chance to
practice the concepts that  I have already
learnt.   The amount
of course material provided for each lesson was just right for me.  That is why I was able to absorb the material
very easily and also was able to meet all the deadlines on time.  I have
become unemployed due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.  This course helped me greatly to engage myself

The simple way in which the content was explained.2.

However, as a complete beginner, I was very put off by the way that the graded assignments had very little link to the content 'taught' in lectures. In fact, the lectures seem to ramble from one thing to another rather than having the teacher sit down and give step-by-step examples on how to code. Therefore, most of what I learnt was through the textbook that is provided for free anyway, so I may as well have taught a lot of it to myself.

5704,2020-09-06,"To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short. It was far too basic and slow paced. Considering how little is taught, even for a beginner's course in Python, it could hardly be described as college-level material.The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate for a grade school level classroom--not something for college students or working professionals. Even if the goal were to teach those having absolutely no programming experience, the course could accomplish that while providing more content by doing the following: keep up the pace of the lectures, give better (more relevant) coding examples, and remove the portions of the lectures that are irrelevant to the course objectives.Is the course worth the price? Hell no. If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end. The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes. One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.I'm not sure about the value of all of the videos titled ""Office Hours."" They look like nothing more than self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great I am making this irrelevant two-minute video in Paris."" They're really nothing more than that.In one video, Severance corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives a polite brush-off: ""other people here would like to speak with me too."" It's obvious that Severance didn't set up the interview beforehand or warn the other person that he was going to be videotaped. Things like that make the professor look naive, unprepared, and unprofessional. After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did Severance make me watch that?"" ""What was the point?""

6418,2020-08-26,"Overall, this is a great introduction to Python. Prior to this class, I had zero Python experience; however, my review will be biased because not only am I a graduate of University of Michigan, but I also have 30+ years of software experience including Structured Text (CoDeSys), C, C++, C#, and a half-dozen others.Professor Severance is a great teacher â I wish I could have had him as a professor during my years at U of M.Four-point-nine-star review: because I find a few things lacking in these introductory software courses, and this one in particular.Development and debugging: line by line stepping through our code using a âbetterâ software tool. Atom and the IDLE tools are VERY lacking in development capabilities.It is fundamental to software development to be able to step through your code, line by line, set breakpoints, and easily examine variables and values as they change. And I believe this would make it MUCH more clear to new software students exactly what a CPU is doing when processing code.I know the video course tried very hard to âsketchâ out what is really going on in While loops, For loops, If-then-else statements, and function calls. However, I think that students, especially students new to software overall, would benefit greatly if they could use a more professional tool than the Atom and IDLE tools. And if thatâs not possible, I think the videos should show the actual animation of stepping through line-by-line and setting breakpoints in example software, using such a tool.Visual Studio Community version is FREE online, and has all these capabilities. Iâm not promoting Microsoft or this tool, other than itâs an excellent example of the types of tools students should use for really learning software. And they will benefit greatly from this experience when they evolve to the professional level.And two footnotes about Python:(a) Implicit conversion from int to float, and(b) indentation.These are my main âbeefsâ against Python; in the 21st century, implicit conversions should never be allowed. And the fact that Python 3 (not Python 2) implicitly converts integers to floats during mathematical operations will bar it from being an enterprise professional language. Indentation instead of braces or other blocking methods: over and over again students will be stumped as to why their code does not work because tabs and spaces are being mingled in the code. A professional language should not do that. Indeed, one must carefully make sure the settings convert tabs to spaces.",5,completer,2543,pos,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999997748858898}",en,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.9905}",0.9905,pos

The course is ideally clear and so well structured and balanced, so it is not an iota worse than your favourite TV show! Albeit with one little, but a very crucial difference â you learn REALLY USEFUL THINGS.And anyone can learn it, for sure. The course requires no special talent or knowledge, it just gives you them both, if you honestly complete all tasks with full dedication. It inspires you to create and program. It's absolutely true that in the middle of the XXI century there will be two types of people â algorithm makers and algorithm executes. So if you want to have an impact in your future life, ENROLL!

I myself being a student of computer science and having learnt C++ found it very lucrative to speed through some of the portions of the course (the playback speed feature is really handy) and at the end of each week I could reinforce my learning through the assignments and reviews. Also liked the concept of Peer Graded Assignments and how it boosts the peer learning process in some ways.

6851,2020-08-19,"If I were to compare the quality of this class to something I would say that this class is like a Chess class that spends 30 minutes explaining how pawns work and then asks you to move Knight to C3. ""Wait, what piece is the Knight? How does the Knight move again? What's C3? Help!""  That's basically what you will get out of this course.This class is not a good choice for someone starting from the ground up. It's no so much that it doesn't cover entry-level concepts, rather it fails to elaborate on these concepts. The feedback from the quizzes doesn't point you in the direction where you can learn from your mistakes.Likewise the assignments are often two steps ahead of the video, meaning that when error messages pop up in the auto-grader there is no way to figure out where you can learn what you did wrong. the videos will cover steps a, b, and c but the assignments expect you to know steps d, e, and f. This leaves students to discuss the answers in the forums or on other sites which I understand is frowned upon. However for ""green as grass"" students this is the only way to get anything done. And when students try to explain how the code actually works to each other their threads get locked down, only cryptic and vague responses to issues will remain.  That is abysmal.When I seem to get more help from other students in the comments than from the moderators in the forum, that is an issue. And lets talk about the moderator, there is only one. One for how many students? One for how many questions? Even if there was just 5 more people answering in the forums it would greatly improve the quality of this class. And those moderators should do more than just refer students back to the book which often provides insufficient information to tackle a problem. This class needs to be reviewed extensively.

9120,2020-07-24,"The course is extremely easy, even for those with no programming background like myself, but I suspect this is on purpose: it helps dispel anxieties and build confidence, so that students feel encouraged to continue with the specialization or seek out more advanced individual courses. I know that I found myself creating more complicated versions of the assignments and looking up ways to make them work, but that's a good thing: it's important for a course to spark curiosity and invite experimentation. Obviously, you need to keep your expectations in check: you won't turn into a professional programmer at the end of one easy course or specialization. However, you can start figuring out how to automate some of your own work or how to talk to programmers if you're working on a project together.  As a bonus, Dr. Severance explains things very clearly and is quite enjoyable to watch, which was a nice change from other MOOCs I've taken before. I'm only giving it four stars because I think there should have been more assignments, as well as a mechanism to discourage plagiarism (it was obvious to me that some participants copied their code from various online sources, which is partly why they couldn't figure out why it didn't work or didn't produce the correct output).",4,completer,1280,pos,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999979536126911}",en,"{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.232, 'compound': 0.9938}",0.9938,pos
