While it is an interesting way to define a Data Scientist, a data scientist is what a data scientist does, I think it does not give a student a reasonable idea about the professional. This definition may be valid, but, to me, indicates that the profession is not well-established yet.

1065,2020-08-21,"[Reviewing the entire IBM Data Science specialization but points are applicable for
each course]I signed up for the
IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start
it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually
started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making
my way though it and I was amazed â¦ amazed of how much a pile of
bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses
and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldnât take it
anymore. Hereâs why:1. First and
foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at
least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other
students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me
but whatever, lets move on.2. The in-video
quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous â¦ you are
expected to have memorized content word by word rather than
understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of
the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.3. The final
assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which
IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing
stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.4. We eventually got
to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter
notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no
proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read
python and seaborn code in the SQL courseâs tasks even though
python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.5. And my final and
biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel
like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred
excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells
here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM
Watson Studio are â¦ they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing
problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my
assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open
source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter
they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more
focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality
content.6. Now after
finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly
filled in basically letting them know their specialization if
terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent
them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this
course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to
IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfbI was very saddened
by the quality of the specialization and the content and was
wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses
but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out
it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would
recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting
next week.In conclusion, I got
this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to
say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated
by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their
courses.",1,completer,3274,neg,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999948942466034}",en,"{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': -0.3375}",-0.3375,neg

1738,2020-06-22,"I'm writing this review because it looks like people are too harsh on judging an introductory course. Yes, if you have any experience in data science this introductory course is a bore, but we have to look at it as a statistician. Specifically, the sample set of people who know about data science, maybe who have experience with R or Python or C, do not represent the population total. If we look at the population representing the people who are taking this course, the diversity is outstanding. It would consist of people from different parts of the world, different age groups, different occupations and different levels of experience with data science. Through observation, I am banking that this course is attuned towards a random sample of that population -- ranging from those with comfortable experience to no experience; from high school students to Ph.D. students; from U.S. to India, etc. So if you are new to data science, whatever your age group, whatever your profession, or wherever your location you are in, this is for you to get a macro perspective on what data science is :D.

PROS: I 
really enjoyed the ""documentary-style"" videos based on interviews with experts, along with the readings. CONS: The 
animated videos are a bit too fast paced 
and superficial. Also, some of the questions in the quizzes are outright 
confusing. They don't really assess 
whether you understood the content of the videos and readings, but rather whether you remembered some key sentences by heart. There are also several typos 
here and there in the material. Overall,

2244,2020-05-24,"The course was OK, which is probably about the best you can shoot for on an ""introduction to the subject"" type of course. I do have one comment regarding the narrated videos (as opposed to the interview videos). The little animations of block graphics are snazzy. But do they contribute ANYTHING to the lesson? I would say no. The video should help the viewer parse the audio or put it in context or something. Popping up block figures of people in ties when the audio mentions executives is just video for the sake of video. In fact for me, having this constantly-changing screen with little bits moving around makes it harder to concentrate on the actual content, 100% of which is contained in the narration. So I ended up muting the audio and just reading the text. Perhaps the video helps certain types of learners, although it's hard to imagine how. Anyway, I just wanted to suggest that in cases where video has no helpful contribution, maybe consider making it a reading assignment.Other than that, I want to thank you for your contribution to making learning more accessible to everyone.",3,completer,1095,neu,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967545532239}",en,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.8253}",0.8253,pos

However, don't expect to build predictive models from this course. They go through surface knowledge of Data Science (which is a ridiculously broad term so it makes sense to do so as a starting point). There's some Watson projects which is pretty cool, but Watson is like a software where you can implement Data Science. You're not building any new models as such through code here.It all comes down to personal preference, if you want to learn about what Data Science is and how Watson works, this could be a good path for you to take. For me, my goal was to be able to understand the mathematics and thereby code in popular languages and frameworks, basically going into the micro level rather than having a general surface knowledge of everything. I learned alot about coding from Lynda's Python and Data Science Essentials. However, ML is a very broad umbrella, and I narrowed down my discipline to learning Deep Learning with Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization which in my opinion is an excellent course if your learning goal aligns with mine.

I liked the simple way in which the concepts were explained using videos and animations. I didn't understand why so much emphasis was given on the format of a report at the end of this course. Yes, a good report is important, but the amount of space it got in this course seemed disproportionate. After all, (as per this course) a Data Scientist ought to be a good story-teller. Then why give such a structured, almost regimented, format for a report? The course is about 'What is Data Science"", not on how a Data Scientist writes a report.

It is absolutely NOT inherently an automated process from end to end. The final ""capstone"" assignment which was essentially regurgitation was graded incorrectly. Especially with respect to the final reading. Students were asked to list the ""main"" sections of what should constitute a report to be given to stakeholders following data science based research. Firstly, dictating sections is stupid as you need to customise to your audience and NO, doing it that way should never be prescribed as universal. Secondly, even adhering strictly to what the reading said and ONLY what the reading said, the grading criteria was WRONG. How on earth did you list Appendices, CLEARLY stated as OPTIONAL as one of the 10 main sections? Not only that, you listed sub-sections as whole sections. For students that got the answer correct, I graded them as such and commented that I'm doing this because the criteria was in fact erroneous. It's one MOOC. How hard is it to get the basics right? What happened to the IBM culture that used to make software engineers write all their code without a compiler to MAKE SURE what they were building was as correct as possible before compiling because of a focus on quality?

4461,2020-01-12,"Really disappointed with the whole specialisation... I am leaving this review here because probably you might not check the others courses before you start it. Specialisation is short and it is the only good thing about it. It took me I think 10-12 hours to do it.So first of all the whole thing is not really informative. A lack of videos - Most of the time there is only ""power-point""presentation with code written on it.  I don't really understand why they have narrator who just read text - no emotions almost like a machine.Courses:1. You will spend a lot of time learning listening to videos about how sexy is to be data scientist... and that parents start sending their daughters for data science (sic!), and that it is a new science... Plus some rather simple information which you rather know taking into consideration you want to study it online. At least it is nice to watch - there is life in it.2. You will spend the whole course watching different notebooks like jupyter R studio etc . without really learning any useful stuff. In the end you will just click run to create some already written commands in python. Yeap that's it.  I know it is intro but adding 1 +1 third time in different console... 3.  You will learn some methodology - A lot of complicated knowledge read by narrator who is not making it easier or more interesting. Almost like somebody reading you technical book...4. SQL - you will try to learn it from presentations. I think there are no proper videos just images in narrated power point presentation. I watched some coursera lectures about sql before but still I had problems with following it. To make it worst you will have to use IBM products which are FREE - other reviews are probably outdated. The problem is that materials from this course are also outdated. So they are presenting you IBM tool-set which is already different. It is a problem because they are not even trying to show how they work just where to click.

I am hear to learn and depend on you to have accurate learning materials and tests that follow the course materials.  I create procedure manuals for staff.  One of the first things I do when I finish a new manual, is go through each thing, step by step, to make sure it is accurate.  My manuals are for a handful of people, your learning materials are for thousands of people, many of which have language barriers, as English is not their first language.  So this makes it even more important for your assignments/tests to be extremely clear in their questions and the answers correct according to the course material.  When you have a tremendous amount of complaints about this on the discussion forums and no one of power is doing anything to correct this, this is a major issue.I had started a specialization with Coursera a few months before and quit near the end of course two due to extreme frustration with these same issues.

5921,2019-07-21,"  ""Data science is what data scientist do."" I firmly subscribe to the belief in this definition given by Professor White at NYU Stern. Science is never about human accomplishments, a set of opinions or truth. It is a system of the methodology of exploring the truth, understanding oneself and their respective environment, challenging one's constrained thinking and improving the life of mankind for the better. Data science is within the grand scale of science but add a ""sexy"" touch to it. (as declared by Harvard Business Review) How so? Before data science, we were obsessed with the idea of finding actual causation and could not settle with a strong correlation; We claimed that no one can predict the outcome of any event despite our instinctive use of different indicative signal in my daily life, We argued that artificial intelligence should be rooted in its ""general use"" nature and should be based on a strong logical structure. However, after the rise of machine learning (especially deep learning networks) was made possible by the increasing computing power, a new direction of understanding the world with a ""specific use"" type artificial intelligence have arrived.Data scientist integrates the traditional theory that has either been overlooked due to misunderstandings, such as Probability Theory and regular statistical Regression  or tools that have been unused due to lack of technological support, such as machine learning, to formulate an understanding of our behavior, our system and consequently improving the life of mankind for the better. With the identification of statical features, the utilization of machine learning and the employment of analytic with reinforcement of the talents(engineers, developer, financial analyst from the respective discipline, data scientist serve as the hub of hacking complex problems and story-telling of data across the industry.And this course will give you clear outlook of that.",4,completer,1944,pos,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999984309432998}",en,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.9299}",0.9299,pos

6193,2019-06-22,Content provided by the course is very short & videos are handy. One or two page reading material is a cherry on top of this beautiful cake. Course material provided by Prof. Murtaza Haider is excellent & the only professor I can surely say has a great understanding of the subject & clear mindset of what he is going to talk next. I personally believe that short clips of various people inside course videos can be neglected as everyone is repeating everyone else & they are not actually contributing any knowledge to the course but just making a random & irrelevant comments about Data Science. This course can be more enhanced if we put more content from Prof. Haider & Prof. White & give it a more insightful background. Overall I enjoyed this course & I have gained a lot of knowledge about Data Science now.

7016,2019-03-02,"What did I like about the course?
* The contents discribed in the videos were very interesting.
* The rating system is great because you also have to rate other people yourself. With this system you get to know the motiviation and background of other attendees.
* Also, setting a due date is a good decision, as this motivates one to get through the course.

What was not so good?
* Some of the questions were way to easy. Due to the fact that you will be certified at the end, I would like to compare the degree of difficulty with that of a university/collage. After all, we want to be reasonably prepared for the job market after this course. Some questions were even superfluous. In the video the speaker says something like ""With Zepplin Notebooks you can run code in different languages"". Immediately afterwards the video is paused and the question is ""True or false? With Zepplin Notebooks you can run code in different languages""... I hope, since it is the first course, the difficulty will increase through out the course and we can get our hands dirty.
* I don't know if this is a bad point but three weeks for this amount of content is way to long. I think it depends on the attendee but you can finish this course easily in one day.

What else could be improved?
* In some situations, I wish the video player was a bit larger, because you'd like to read along with the script but still want to see everything and with such a small player, it's not possible.
* If you're working on a laptop and have 2 browser windows open side by side, the page is not responsive enough and the player will appear cut off.

I get that you're trying to find something that's easy to peer review, but really - one random person's opinion on how to format a paper?  That was about as unimaginative / uninteresting as you could possibly get and only goes further into making data science seem like it's going to be an incredibly boring-to-other-than-totally-left-brained-control-freak humans.  How about easing it up a bit on the precise content and let people answer more about the Voltaire discussion, (i.e. thinking about how you want to present the results even before writing the report)?  How about having people talk about the first professor's discussion of what he did with the Toronto busses - going off on his own to acquire priorly-unrelated data to determine correlations?  These are the kinds of things that are going to help someone become a good data scientist later in life, not whether they could list 10 italicized bullet points about how precisely one form of report, (i.e. a very formal, long form - often only used in its entirety in academia and generally inappropriate in other contexts).",3,completer,2039,neu,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999970567699592}",en,"{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9625}",0.9625,pos
