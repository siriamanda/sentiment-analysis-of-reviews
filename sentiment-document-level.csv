It reminded me of learning the beginning stages of Pascal and how fluent you became in the language; especially when writing/constructing basic functions. Whether you have crossed paths with a programming language previously or not doesn't matter. You are able to quickly pick up the basics of Python's control flow and the short quizzes & assignments help in solidifying these concepts.

Dr. Chuck's class was totally different! He really took time to make all the concepts easily understandable even to the layman. Oh and he has such a glowing sense of humor lol.

Dr. Chuck talks about understanding as you go along and true to form I did not understand until the very end. I did make it through after months of challenges and trying my hardest to actually understand. I almost gave up on myself at the very end but thanks to coursera I was able to finish strong.

1282,2021-01-07,"I have greatly enjoyed learning python with Prof Chuck. The videos and textbook provide examples that are easy for me to follow. I can go at my own pace and just have to make sure to submit quizzes and homework assignments on time. The quizzes were a good way for me to gauge my understanding of the weekly lessons. As long as you understand the material then the homework assignments aren't too bad. Also, reading the chapter after watching all the weekly videos  plus doing the exercises at the end of each chapter was a great way to prep for the quizzes.

I wasn't sure if I would understand python since I had trouble learning C++ in the past and thought this might be too hard to learn. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I started to understand things and put the pieces together to create my programs. I plan to complete the remaining 4 classes to get the python certification.

This was a very good learning experience and I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn python. Thank you Prof Chuck.",5,completer,1023,pos,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999975760302142}",en,"{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.9832}",0.9832,pos

1637,2020-12-24,"There's a lot the class doesn't cover, things it doesn't do a great job at being a beginning class. For the FIREST class on python, I'm incredibly disappointed with how its run. The not being able to see what others did and thus know if thats the same thing you did wrong means that every time you are unsure you have to ask a teacher, which can take hours or days to be replied to. I ended up not using any teacher help and instead had to contact a friend who does programming to explain things that were in the homework but no where in the text or videos to explain things that SHOULD have been explained before getting the homework. If you're willing to do your own legwork or don't mind waiting between responses, I'm sure the class is great. Personally, I'm extremely disappointed. Look at the discussion each week, there's tons of questions of just not understanding why things aren't working. Watch out for information in the homework that is wrong or needs to be changed to make it correct instead of leaving blanks which would have been easier to understand in a beginning class. It constantly felt like trying to figure out what they were tricking you with in in the homework by giving you information and equations that don't actually work as written. I'm just not impressed and as someone with a teaching background, I'm pretty disappointed in the execution of this class that should be an absolutely basic class but its also trying to trick you in ways.

I think the fact that his lectures are transcribed will be very helpful for people who do not speak English as their first language.

Efficiently writing the program such that it actually takes less computer time is something that is difficult to each. Computers work well doing iterative tasks that with fast processors, we do consider how efficient our coding is. In the old days of the cold war when processing power was a competitive and under export control, the Soviet Union which lacked equivalent processor power learned to write code that was very efficient. Hence when the Soviet Union fell, Soviet (Russian) programmer were in high demand by western software companies. Some western software companies even set up research labs in Russia to take advantage of the pool of talented programmers.I will take a bit of time to think in programming language again to write efficient code in Python.

I recommend that you complete the quizes as soon as you finsh the lecture while the content is 'fresh' in your mind.The assignments can be challenging; for me; it took a few attempts to get them right. Sometime, it's easy to forget all the syntax requirements. that said, as you complete each assignemnt, your confidence builds up. If at first you struggle with an assignment, leave it for a few hours or a day, then, come back to it.

I really liked this review because it's video format which works really 
well for those who have already attempted to learn Python many times 
before through online text resources. It's a fresh style where there is a
 'teacher' that explains the lesson. Dr. Charles Severance is skilled in
 laymanizing programming concepts and most definitely knows what a 
student feels in front of a foreign (programming language)

Some other platforms might look shiny but they build too quickly, if you are completely new at programming it really needs to be this simple because it's a hard skill to learn, and I also think the order of the lessons makes the most sense.  Having the videos and the book is really helpful.

The course is not as rigorous as I expected it to be but it covered the basics of Python.

5756,2020-09-06,"To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short. It was far too basic and slow paced. Considering how little is taught, even for a beginner's course in Python, it could hardly be described as college-level material.The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate for a grade school level classroom--not something for college students or working professionals. Even if the goal were to teach those having absolutely no programming experience, the course could accomplish that while providing more content by doing the following: keep up the pace of the lectures, give better (more relevant) coding examples, and remove the portions of the lectures that are irrelevant to the course objectives.Is the course worth the price? Hell no. If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end. The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes. One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.I'm not sure about the value of all of the videos titled ""Office Hours."" They look like nothing more than self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great I am making this irrelevant two-minute video in Paris."" They're really nothing more than that.In one video, Severance corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives a polite brush-off: ""other people here would like to speak with me too."" It's obvious that Severance didn't set up the interview beforehand or warn the other person that he was going to be videotaped. Things like that make the professor look naive, unprepared, and unprofessional. After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did Severance make me watch that?"" ""What was the point?""

I am really starting to see the potential of online learning and how this particular course makes it so easy for students from any background whatsoever to get starter with Python programming. I myself being a student of computer science and having learnt C++ found it very lucrative to speed through some of the portions of the course (the playback speed feature is really handy) and at the end of each week I could reinforce my learning through the assignments and reviews. Also liked the concept of Peer Graded Assignments and how it boosts the peer learning process in some ways.

The feedback from the quizzes doesn't point you in the direction where you can learn from your mistakes.Likewise the assignments are often two steps ahead of the video, meaning that when error messages pop up in the auto-grader there is no way to figure out where you can learn what you did wrong. the videos will cover steps a, b, and c but the assignments expect you to know steps d, e, and f. This leaves students to discuss the answers in the forums or on other sites which I understand is frowned upon. However for ""green as grass"" students this is the only way to get anything done. And when students try to explain how the code actually works to each other their threads get locked down, only cryptic and vague responses to issues will remain.  That is abysmal.When I seem to get more help from other students in the comments than from the moderators in the forum, that is an issue. And lets talk about the moderator, there is only one. One for how many students? One for how many questions? Even if there was just 5 more people answering in the forums it would greatly improve the quality of this class. And those moderators should do more than just refer students back to the book which often provides insufficient information to tackle a problem. This class needs to be reviewed extensively.  I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone fresh that wants to try to learn code.",1,completer,1902,neg,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967662921324}",en,"{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.908, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': -0.4197}",-0.4197,neg

9237,2020-07-24,"The course is extremely easy, even for those with no programming background like myself, but I suspect this is on purpose: it helps dispel anxieties and build confidence, so that students feel encouraged to continue with the specialization or seek out more advanced individual courses. I know that I found myself creating more complicated versions of the assignments and looking up ways to make them work, but that's a good thing: it's important for a course to spark curiosity and invite experimentation. Obviously, you need to keep your expectations in check: you won't turn into a professional programmer at the end of one easy course or specialization. However, you can start figuring out how to automate some of your own work or how to talk to programmers if you're working on a project together.  As a bonus, Dr. Severance explains things very clearly and is quite enjoyable to watch, which was a nice change from other MOOCs I've taken before. I'm only giving it four stars because I think there should have been more assignments, as well as a mechanism to discourage plagiarism (it was obvious to me that some participants copied their code from various online sources, which is partly why they couldn't figure out why it didn't work or didn't produce the correct output).",4,completer,1280,pos,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999966037570556}",en,"{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.232, 'compound': 0.9938}",0.9938,pos
